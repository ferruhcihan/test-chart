# otomi-charts

Repo with generic helm charts used by 

There are currently two types of workloads:

- `deployment`: k8s native combination of deployment + svc + (optional) service monitor.
- `ksvc`: [knative](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/) service, which takes care of doing all the work.

For each workload a service account is created that uses the pull secret created by Otomi to pull images from the team's private repo in Harbor.

Output examples:

-  `deploy`
   ```
   cd deployment
   helm template -f minimal-values.yaml . # test with minimal options
   helm template -f full-values.yaml . # test with all options
   ```
-  `ksvc`
   ```
   cd ksvc
   helm template -f minimal-values.yaml . # test with minimal options
   helm template -f full-values.yaml . # test with all options
   ```
