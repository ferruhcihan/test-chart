Repo with generic helm charts for Otomi

## deployment

There are currently two types of deployable deployments:

- `deploy`: k8s native combination of deployment + svc.
- `ksvc`: [knative](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/) service, which takes care of doing all the work.

Output examples:

-  `deploy` type:
   ```
   helm template -f test-common.yaml -f test-deploy.yaml .
   ```
-  `ksvc`  type:
   ```
   helm template -f test-common.yaml -f test-ksvc.yaml .
   ```
