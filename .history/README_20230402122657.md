# otomi-charts

Repo with generic helm charts for Otomi workloads.

Output examples:

-  `deploy`
   ```
   cd deployment
   helm template -f minimal-values.yaml . # test with minimal options
   helm template -f full-values.yaml . # test with all options
   ```
-  `ksvc`
   ```
   cd ksvc
   helm template -f test-ksvc.yaml .
   ```
