# otomi-charts

Repo with generic helm charts for Otomi workloads.

There are currently two types of deployable workloads:

- `deployment`: k8s native combination of deployment + svc.
- `ksvc`: [knative](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/) service, which takes care of doing all the work.

Output examples:

-  `deploy`
   ```
   cd deployment
   helm template -f test-deploy.yaml .
   ```
-  `ksvc`
   ```
   cd ksvc
   helm template -f test-ksvc.yaml .
   ```
